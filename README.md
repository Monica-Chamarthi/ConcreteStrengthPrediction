# ConcreteStrengthPrediction
* Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering.

* concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

* The aim of this project is to predict the Compressive Strength of concrete using different machine learning algorithms and analyzing their performances

* Techniques used: Data Preprocessing, Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regression,Support Vector Machines,KNN Regressor,Decision Tree Regressor, random forest modeling

* Built with: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
